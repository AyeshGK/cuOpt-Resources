# cuOpt-Resources
A collection of NVIDIA cuOpt samples and other resources.

cuOpt is a collection of GPU accelerated solvers for logistics with a focus on the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). By accelerating the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW), cuOpt helps to efficiently manage delivery fleet, increase delivery capacity, and minimize failed deliveries - turning last mile logistics from a problematic cost into a competitive advantage.
